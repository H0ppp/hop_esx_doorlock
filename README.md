# hop_esx_doorlock
A copy of [esx_doorlock](https://github.com/esx-community/esx_doorlock) with NUI implementation.

The configuration and functionality is exactly the same as esx_doorlocks, the only change is the 3D text is removed and a simplistic NUI is shown in it's place.

When unlocked, the display will show green and when locked the display shows red. If the user has keys to the door the [E] prompt will show on the display to toggle the doors state.
